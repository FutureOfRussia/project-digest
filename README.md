### What's this?
This is the place for my creative experiments. Ultimately, I see it as a UI Kit, a set of responsive interfaces with powerful animations.
### What's inside?
**Based on [rn-sceleton](https://github.com/FutureOfRussia/rn-skeleton).**  

**Main libraries used:**
  * Animation - [React Native Reanimated](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-reanimated/)
  * Gestures - [React Native Gesture Handler](https://software-mansion.github.io/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/getting-started.html)
  * Tool kit for React Native Reanimated and Gesture Handler - [react-native-redash](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-redash)
  * Element transition - [react-native-shared-element](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-shared-element)
